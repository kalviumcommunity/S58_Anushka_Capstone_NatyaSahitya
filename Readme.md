## The name of my project is NatyaSahitya.


### This is a website which is having different types of classical dance forms in India.


#### Here are some key features of my Capstone project:-

- In my project there will be 9 classical dance forms present in India.
- In every form some history and information will be given.
- For each dance form the Theory and Practical will be present Chapter/Stage wise.
- User can only access to the Theory and Practical part when they are Logged In.
- On some theory parts you can only access by taking premium. 
- User can post their videos on the website.
